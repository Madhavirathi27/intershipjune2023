Rajasthan ‘Land of Kings’ or ‘Land of Kingdom’ is India’s largest state by area.
 
The state located on northwest part of country and is a home of cultural diversity. 
Its features include the ruins of Indus Valley Civilization, Temples, Forts and Fortresses in almost every city. 

Rajasthan divided into 9 regions;
 Ajmer State, Hadoti, Dhundhar, Gorwar, Shekhawati, Mewar, Marwar, Vagad and Mewat which are equally rich in its heritage and artistic contribution.
 These regions have a parallel history which goes along with that of the state.
A world heritage site, Keoladeo National Park near Bharatpur, known for its bird life. 
Apart from this state has two national tiger reserves namely Ranthambore National Park at Sawai Madhopur and Sariska Tiger Reserve in Alwar.

The State was formed on 30th March 1949 when Rajputana – name as adopted by British Crown was merged into the Dominion of India.
 Jaipur being largest city was declared as capital of the state.

The early history of Rajasthan includes some of the great Maharanas, Nawabs and Rulers. 
Prominent among them were Prithiviraj Chouhan, Samrat Hem Chandra Vikramaditya (also known as Hemu),
 Mughal Emperor Akbar, Maharana Udai Singh, Maharana Pratap, Raja Maan Singh and others.

Rajasthan’s formerly independent kingdoms developed a rich architectural and cultural heritage;
 same can be seen today in numerous forts and palaces, which are enriched by feature of Muslim and Jain Architecture.
